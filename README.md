# grunt-legacy-config [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-legacy-config.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/grunt-legacy-config)

> Grunt's config methods, as a standalone library.

## Heads up!

This is not ready for use yet! We'll update the readme when it's ready to go, feel free to star the project if you want updates in the meantime!

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```bash
npm i grunt-legacy-config --save-dev
```

## Usage

```js
var config = require('grunt-legacy-config');
```

## API

_(Nothing yet.)_

## TODO

**First:**

_(loosely in this order...)_

* [x] migrate code
* [x] migrate tests
* [x] get tests passing with 100% parity
* [ ] coverage reports
* [ ] API documentation, written as code comments
* [ ] Add the event to the changelogs of both libraries

**Next:**

* [ ] replace core `grunt.config` internal module with `grunt-legacy-config`
* [ ] remove any dependencies that are no longer needed from grunt.
